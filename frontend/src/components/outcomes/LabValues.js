      <ReadMore>
        <p className="text">
          Lab values are crucial for assessing your chances of success with
          fertility treatments and understanding your remaining fertile years.
          Loamy can help interpret what these numbers mean for you.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          Baseline hormone levels, such as AMH and AFC, offer insights into how
          time affects your fertility. They also provide information about your
          egg reserve, aiding in decisions about when to conceive or freeze
          eggs/embryos. For example, an antral follicle count of 20-40 suggests
          about a decade of fertile years remaining.
        </p>
        <p className="text">
          If this information is new to you and you haven't yet completed a
          hormone panel, consider getting tested at a fertility clinic, or ask
          your primary care provider for a test. At-home tests may also provide
          useful initial data, though they may not be as accurate as laboratory
          testing.

          <p className="text">
            ðŸ’¡ ðŸ‘‰ The accuracy of at-home tests can vary widely, influenced by
            the manufacturer, the conditions during shipping, and whether the
            test was conducted on the appropriate day of your cycle. Often,
            these tests cannot provide a comprehensive overview without a
            physical examination, and your Reproductive Endocrinologist (REI)
            will likely require you to repeat them.

          Comparing your AMH (Anti-MÃ¼llerian Hormone) and AFC (Antral Follicle
          Count) levels to those of women in your age group can provide valuable
          context. Generally, higher levels of AMH and AFC indicate a larger
          ovarian reserve. However, it's important to note that high AMH levels
          do not guarantee the ability to conceive. AMH alone is not a reliable
          predictor of overall fertility.
