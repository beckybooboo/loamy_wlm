        There's a considerable amount of misleading information online about
        fertility, with some sources suggesting simplistic solutions like "just
        relax" or take a specific supplement to miraculously boost fertility.

        Fortunately, there's substantial research focused on behavior
        modifications that can genuinely enhance fertility‚Äîthough these findings
        are frequently overshadowed by the noisy fertility wellness influencer

        At the very least, we see acupuncture as an excellent mindfulness
        practice to alleviate stress during fertility treatments.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        A meta-analysis reviewed the effectiveness of acupuncture as a
        complementary therapy for diminished ovarian response (DOR) by examining
        seven randomized controlled trials involving 516 women. Although the
        overall quality of these studies was generally low, the results suggest
        that acupuncture, in conjunction with controlled ovarian
        hyperstimulation (stims therapy), can significantly increase the number
        of retrieved oocytes, enhance endometrium thickness, and increase the
        antral follicle count. Furthermore, acupuncture was observed to reduce
        follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and raise estradiol levels,
        indicating its potential to improve ovarian function in DOR patients.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Despite the rarity of clinical studies on Western medicine interventions
        like acupuncture in well-known, mainstream medical journals, many women
        undergoing egg freezing report finding these treatments to be
        stress-reducing and beneficial to their journey.

                <strong>Tip 1: Compare medication prices</strong> - Some
                pharmacies specialize in specific fertility drugs and offer
                significant discounts. Pharmacies such as Mandell's, Kings,
                Alto, Freedom, Encompass, and Village Pharmacy are known for
                drugs like Gonal F and Cetrotide. Meanwhile, MDR and Apthorp are
                preferred for Follistim and Ganirelix. These drugs are
                therapeutic equivalents, and you have the freedom to compare
                prices across pharmacies. The cost difference can be
                substantial, with one pharmacy charging $7,000 and another
                nearby offering nearly half that price.

                  Tip 2: Avoid buying all your medications at once
                </strong>{" "}
                - Rather than purchasing all your medications upfront based on
                your provider's recommendations, take a more calculated
                approach. It's common for patients to end up with excess
                medication.

                Despite the common application of ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm
                Injection), research indicates that in situations lacking
                male-factor infertility, the fertilization rates with ICSI are
                similar to those without it. So, if ICSI is suggested in your
                treatment protocol, it's important to ask your healthcare
                provider about its necessity. Knowing why it's being recommended
                can assist you in making informed choices, possibly helping you
                avoid unnecessary costs.
