        There's a considerable amount of misleading information online about
        fertility, with some sources suggesting simplistic solutions like "just
        relax" or take a specific supplement to miraculously boost fertility.

      <p className="mb-4 text">
        Fortunately, there's substantial research focused on behavior
        modifications that can genuinely enhance fertility‚Äîthough these findings

        Research indicates a link between stress and fertility outcomes. A study found that
        women with higher levels of alpha-amylase, a stress biomarker,
        experienced a 29% decrease in fecundity (resulting in a longer time to
        pregnancy) and were over twice as likely to face infertility compared to
        women with lower levels of this biomarker. You may find practices like meditation, 
        breathwork on a guided app, or visualization to be helpful in reducing stress. 
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text">
      Guided visualization is a mind-body practice wherein you evoke all your senses to 
      experience something in your mind. Olympic athletes use this technique to imagine their 
      race and cancer patients use it before treatment to mentally prepare. This can help control 
      your emotions, physiology, and reduce stress-induced cortisol levels. You can start on 
      YouTube with fertility meditations and if you want to upgrade your practice, <a className="link" href="hhttps://circlebloom.com/shop/?ref=20393">Circle & Bloom</a> offers 
      a series of guided visualization curated for your specific fertility journey.

        Seeking a trustworthy therapist familiar with infertility, engaging your

        Acupuncture & Massage
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text">
        At the very least, we see acupuncture as an excellent mindfulness
        practice to alleviate stress during fertility treatments.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text">
        A meta-analysis reviewed the effectiveness of acupuncture as a
        complementary therapy for diminished ovarian response (DOR) by examining
        seven randomized controlled trials involving 516 women. Although the
        overall quality of these studies was generally low, the results suggest
        that acupuncture, in conjunction with controlled ovarian
        hyperstimulation (stims therapy), can significantly increase the number
        of retrieved oocytes, enhance endometrium thickness, and increase the
        antral follicle count. Furthermore, acupuncture was observed to reduce
        follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels and raise estradiol levels,
        indicating its potential to improve ovarian function in DOR patients.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text">
        Despite the rarity of clinical studies on Western medicine interventions
        like acupuncture in well-known, mainstream medical journals, many women
        undergoing egg/embryo freezing report finding these treatments to be
        stress-reducing and beneficial to their journey. If your interested in 
        exploring acupuncture further, a resource with over <a className="link" href="https://directory.nccaom.org/">21,000 National Board-Certified 
        Acupuncturists</a> is available for reference. Look for a practice that focuses 
        specifically on fertility and you can always cross-reference with 
        referrals from friends or your reproductive endocrinologist.

      Other integrative practices women have used include cupping, acupressure, and massage. Massage is a 
      complementary approach to treatment through safe and compassionate touch. Often studied and used as an

                <strong>Tip 1: Compare medication prices</strong> - Some
                pharmacies specialize in specific fertility drugs and offer
                significant discounts. Pharmacies such as Mandell's, Kings,
                Alto, Freedom, Encompass, and Village Pharmacy are known for
                drugs like Gonal F and Cetrotide. Meanwhile, MDR and Apthorp are

                - Rather than purchasing all your medications upfront based on
                your provider's recommendations, take a more calculated
                approach. It's common for patients to end up with excess

                Despite the common application of ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm
                Injection), research indicates that in situations lacking

                similar to those without it. So, if ICSI is suggested in your
