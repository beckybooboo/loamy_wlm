            Weâ€™re committed to providing transparent, accessible fertility data
            to our users so they can understand their options and make informed

          <p className="mb-4 text">
            We filter the data based on the following ranges of ages and
            diagnoses:
          </p>
          <ul className="mb-4 list-disc list-inside">
            <li>Age ranges: (25 - 29, 30 - 34, 35 - 39, 40+)</li>
            <li>Each single primary infertility diagnosis</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mb-4 text">
            We digest the data, then progress through the filters in order (age
            â†’ diagnosis).
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text">
            If no diagnosis is present, the data provided is filtered only by
            age. Age has been found to be among the single biggest predictors of
            egg quality and treatment success.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text">
            We did not filter on AFC because we did not find it to be
            significant to outcomes in this dataset.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text">
            AMH alone is also not a good single indicator of egg freezing
            success, so we donâ€™t filter on AMH. However, we use your AMH inputs
            to inform the content below.
          </p>
          <p className="text">
            We maintain a minimal threshold of 50 like-outcomes for each data
            visualization to make sure it provides a useful representative
            sample.
