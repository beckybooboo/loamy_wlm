            Women like you often aim to collect 10-20 mature eggs prior to
            fertilization.
          </li>
          <li>
            It's common for not all retrieved eggs to be mature; many times, 40%
            of the eggs collected may be immature. This reduction from retrieved
            to mature eggs is anticipated.
          </li>
          <li>
            The purpose of embryo freezing is to bring as many follicles to
            maturity as possible, and to then fertilize and develop the
            fertilized eggs (embryos) to the blastocyst stage (day five or day
            six embryo).
          </li>
          <li>
            Freezing at the blastocyst stage can improve the chances of
            successful thawing and implantation when the embryos are later
            transferred into the uterus during IVF.
          </li>
          <li>
            Typically, multiple retrievals are needed to accumulate a
            sufficiently large embryo bank for those desiring more than one
            child.

      <p className="mb-4 text">
        Understanding potential outcomes is crucial for estimating your
        expenses, which include both time and effort. Consider the duration of
        the process, the number of cycles needed to achieve a live birth, the
        financial cost of these cycles, and their impact on your mental health
        and relationships. Another key decision is whether to freeze eggs or
        embryos.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text">
        The success rate of live births per embryo transfer ranges between
        34-47%, varying with the egg quality's grading. Opting for genetic
        screening with embryos offers more insight into your frozen embryos
        regarding potential outcomes.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4 text">
        The choice between egg and embryo freezing hinges on several factors,
        including whether infertility is primarily due to female or male
        diagnoses, your short-term budget, and discussions concerning the
        disposition of surplus embryos and eggs.
