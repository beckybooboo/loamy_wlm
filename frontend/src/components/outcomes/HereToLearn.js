            Outcomes for Women Like You

          <p>
            You may have found yourself leaving a few questions blank or
            encountering some that made no sense at all. Not to worry - we're
            here to help!
          </p>
          <p>
            Reproductive health and fertility can be complex subjects, often not
            given attention until we reach our 30s or encounter difficulties
            conceiving. Unfortunately, our current systems have not prioritized
            fertility education, research, or women's health overall. To put it
            bluntly, "We literally know less about every aspect of female
            biology compared to male biology."
          </p>
          <p>
            This is precisely why we're developing Loamy - to bridge the
            knowledge gap in women's health and provide clear fertility
            expectations for individuals like you.

            How To Interpret Your Outcomes
          </h2>
          <div className="mb-6">
            <p>
              Data on fertility treatment outcomes can help you determine
              whether egg freezing, IVF, or natural conception could be viable
              options for you. While age stands out as one of the primary
              indicators of success, it's just one among several factors. If
              these statistics appear overwhelming, it's crucial to bear in mind
              that they may not fully represent your overall health and vitality
              profile.

            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Women like you often aim to collect 10-20 mature eggs.</li>
              <li>
                It's common for not all retrieved eggs to be mature; many times,
                40% of the eggs collected may be immature. This reduction from
                retrieved to mature eggs is anticipated.
              </li>
              <li>
                The purpose of egg freezing is to bring as many follicles to
                maturity as possible, which will then be stored and used for a
                future IVF cycle.
              </li>
              <li>
                In IVF, the objective is to fertilize these mature eggs and
                develop as many of the fertilized eggs (embryos) to the
                blastocyst stage (day five or day six embryo), where they will
                be transferred into the uterus.
              </li>
              <li>
                Typically, multiple retrievals are needed to accumulate a
                sufficiently large egg bank for those desiring more than one
                child.

            <p>
              Weâ€™re committed to providing transparent, accessible fertility
              data to our users so they can understand their options and make
              informed reproductive decisions.

            <h3 className="font-semibold">ðŸ’¡ How we filtered the data:</h3>
            <p>
              We filter the data based on the following ranges of ages,
              diagnoses, and antral follicle counts:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside">
              <li>Age ranges: ('25-29','30-34', '35-39','40+â€™)</li>
              <li>Each single primary infertility diagnosis</li>
              <li>
                Antral follicle counts: AFC {">"} 10 and AFC {"<"}10
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We digest the data, then progress through the filters in order
              (age â†’ diagnosis â†’ AFC).
            </p>
            <p>
              If no diagnosis or AFC count is present, the data provided is
              filtered only by age. Age has been found to be among the single
              biggest predictors of egg quality and treatment success.
            </p>
            <p>
              AMH alone is also not a good single indicator of egg freezing
              success, so we donâ€™t filter on AMH. However, we use your AMH
              inputs to inform the content below.
            </p>
            <p>
              We maintain a minimal threshold of 50 like-outcomes for each data
              visualization to make sure it provides a useful representative
              sample.

              ðŸ’¡ ðŸ‘‰ The accuracy of at-home tests can vary widely, influenced by

              these tests cannot provide a comprehensive overview without a

            freeze eggs/embryos.

            While IVF or egg freezing might not be immediate considerations for
            you, and perhaps they never will be, we view all women as the Chief
            Fertility Officers of their households. If it matches your goals, a

            baseline, lab levels, and overall fertility health.

          <p>
            There's a considerable amount of misleading information online about

            We hope this information and the recommendations provided help
            address three important questions for you:
          </p>
          <ol className="list-decimal list-inside">
            <li>What results can I expect?</li>
            <li>How can I optimize my overall fertility?</li>
            <li>What should I do next?</li>
          </ol>
          <p>
            If becoming a mother (or father) is your goal, remember that there
            are multiple paths to achieve it. Recognizing that you are not
            limited to one narrative can be liberating. Options like IVF,
            adoption, and third-party reproduction/surrogacy offer different
            avenues that you can assess based on your age, health, genetic
            background, and financial circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            The good news is that you have a range of options to consider and
            the freedom to decide your reproductive future.
