      While IVF or egg freezing might not be immediate considerations
      for you, and perhaps they never will be, we view all women as the
      Chief Fertility Officers of their households. If it matches your
      goals, a valuable initial step is to become acquainted with your
      reproductive baseline, lab levels, and overall fertility health.

        <strong>Truth:</strong> Eating nutritious, whole foods, engaging

        health and fertility, regardless of your treatment plan.

        birth.

      <p className="mb-4">
        {" "}
        <strong>Truth:</strong> The success rate for live births from
        thawed eggs is approximately 39%, with the most significant
        factor being the age at which the eggs are frozen.
        Statistically, freezing eggs at a younger age is associated with
        higher success rates.

        <strong>Truth:</strong> ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection)
        is utilized in over 90% of IVF cycles, not just for cases of
        male factor infertility. Many choose it for the perceived
        psychological benefits, although the evidence supporting its
        impact on increasing live birth rates is limited. ICSI costs
        patients between $800 and $2,500 per cycle, while clinics incur
        costs of $50 to $250 to perform it. We'll explore the economics
        of IVF further below.
