                Data on fertility treatment outcomes can help you determine
                whether egg freezing, IVF, or natural conception could be viable
                options for you. While age stands out as one of the primary
                indicators of success, it's just one among several factors. If
                these statistics appear overwhelming, it's crucial to bear in
                mind that they may not fully represent your overall health and
                vitality profile.

                <li>Women like you often aim to collect 10-20 mature eggs.</li>
                <li>
                  It's common for not all retrieved eggs to be mature; many
                  times, 40% of the eggs collected may be immature. This
                  reduction from retrieved to mature eggs is anticipated.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The purpose of egg freezing is to bring as many follicles to
                  maturity as possible, which will then be stored and used for a
                  future IVF cycle.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In IVF, the objective is to fertilize these mature eggs and
                  develop as many of the fertilized eggs (embryos) to the
                  blastocyst stage (day five or day six embryo), where they will
                  be transferred into the uterus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Typically, multiple retrievals are needed to accumulate a
                  sufficiently large egg bank for those desiring more than one

              While IVF or egg freezing might not be immediate considerations
              for you, and perhaps they never will be, we view all women as the
              Chief Fertility Officers of their households. If it matches your

                <strong>Truth:</strong> The success rate for live births from
                thawed eggs is approximately 39%, with the most significant
                factor being the age at which the eggs are frozen.
                Statistically, freezing eggs at a younger age is associated with

                <strong>Truth:</strong> ICSI (Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection)
                is utilized in over 90% of IVF cycles, not just for cases of
                male factor infertility. Many choose it for the perceived
                psychological benefits, although the evidence supporting its
                impact on increasing live birth rates is limited. ICSI costs
                patients between $800 and $2,500 per cycle, while clinics incur
                costs of $50 to $250 to perform it. We'll explore the economics

                There's a considerable amount of misleading information online
                about fertility, with some sources suggesting simplistic
                solutions like "just relax" or take a specific supplement to

                Fortunately, there's substantial research focused on behavior

                findings are frequently overshadowed by the noisy fertility
