            The company was founded after Shauny had a frustrating experience as
            a fertility patient, which led her to pivot her last health tech
            company. Loamy is also inspired by Becky's own frustration
            navigating the healthcare and integrative care systems as a 2x child
            cancer survivor. We have experienced and understand the pain points,
            are passionate about advanced technology, and are activated patients
            ourselves.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-neutral-600">
            We are also deeply committed to women's empowerment, recognizing
            fertility as integral to women's vitality and longevity.
