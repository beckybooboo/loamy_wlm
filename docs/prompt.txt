alright grimoire... You and me are going to make a website together.  I need a site that has a sleek and modern static homepage, and then an application part where you sign in/register with google and are presented with a survey.  The survey questions should be retrieved from a database, and the user's answers to those questions should be stored somewhere associated with that user.
