        "body": "ü§∞ In vitro fertilization (IVF) can be a helpful option for couples who are struggling to have a baby through natural conception. It involves stimulating the ovaries of a woman to retrieve egg(s), and then combining the egg with male sperm outside the body in a laboratory dish to create an embryo. This embryo is then implanted in the woman's uterus, in the hope of a successful pregnancy and a healthy baby."

The embryos (early-stage fertilized eggs) are then stored at very low temperatures, typically in liquid nitrogen, to preserve their biologic age. Yes, if you freeze them at age 25 and come back to use them at age 37, the embryo hasn‚Äôt aged."

These eggs are extracted, frozen, and stored for future use. Egg freezing freezes an unfertilized egg (not combined with male sperm), whereas embryo freezing freezes a fertilized egg."

Aging is one of the biggest causes of low ovarian reserve. DOR is usually diagnosed by a reproductive endocrinologist via tests such as: antral follicle count and blood test for certain hormones like follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, and anti-M√ºllerian hormone (AMH)."

PCOS can make it harder for the ovaries to release eggs regularly. This can lead to irregular menstrual periods or even a lack of periods. Other ovulation disorders include: Hypothalamic amenorrhea, premature ovarian failure and menopause, and hormone imbalances."
